# TEALS 1nd Semester Intro to CS: Project 1 (Mad Libs)

This repo is a jazzed-up example of [Project 1: Mad Libs](https://tealsk12.gitbook.io/intro-cs-2/unit_1/lesson-5/project) for students taking 2nd Semester Intro to Computer Science through [TEALS](https://www.tealsk12.org). It turns a random story from the front page of today's *New York Times* into a Mad Lib with Python 3. These additional bells and whistles are meant to show students all the different things you can do with the Python programming language.

## API Requirements
In addition to the requirements in `requirements.txt`, you will need your own API key to run this program. See[the developer website for instructions to [obtain your own key](https://developer.nytimes.com/get-started).

## Disclaimer
Although there are other, arguabily better, ways to structure Python code, write docstrings, concatenate strings, etc, the conventions in this file reflect the current knowledge of students taking the course.
