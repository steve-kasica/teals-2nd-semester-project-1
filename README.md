# Space Opera Mad Lib

This file is a jazzed-up example of [Project 1: Mad Libs](https://tealsk12.gitbook.io/intro-cs-2/unit_1/lesson-5/project) for students taking 2nd Semester Intro to Computer Science through [TEALS](https://www.tealsk12.org). It turns a random story from the front page of today's *New York Times* into a Mad Lib using part-of-speech tagging in Python 3.

## Requirements

In order to run this program, you will need your own API key. See[the developer website for instructions to [obtain your own key](https://developer.nytimes.com/get-started).

## Disclaimer
